        <h3>Summary Of The Week</h3>
        <p>This week in class we learned a lot of neat things like how to use certain shortcuts in VS Code<br> 
            which ended up helping a lot. I ended up focusing a little bit more on the css and java side of things<br>
            This week in class in order to make my portfolio stand out. 
        </p>

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>
            <p>
                I went ahead a bit and got a menu working in my portfolio using css and java.<br>
                If you want to see how it works you can inspect this page and look at the sources.<br>
                The sources should be called index.css and index.js.
