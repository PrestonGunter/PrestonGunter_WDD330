        <h2>How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>
            This week I wanted to focus more on how the JavaScript language works.<br>
            Here are some of my note that I took during my studying.<br> 

            <h3>Understanding the JS engine and runtime</h3>
            In the JS engine there are two important things that help us execute JS code.<br>
            These are the call stack and the heap. The call stack is where are code is executed.<br>
            The heap is where we store objects in memory. 

            <h3>Compilation Vs Interpretation</h3>
            <strong>Compilation:</strong>Entire code is converted into machine code at once and written to a binary
             file that can be executed by a computer.<br>

             <strong>Interpretation:</strong>Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line.<br>

             JavaScript used to only be a interpreted language but for modern day web apps it now uses<br>
             a combanation of both compilation and interpretation. This is because interpretation is to slow<br>
             by itself.<br>

             JavaScript now uses something called <strong>Just-in-time(JIT) compilation:</strong> This is where all of the code<br>
             is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately. 

             <h3>Scoping and Scope in JavaScript</h3>
             
             <strong>Scoping:</strong> How our program's variables are organized and accessed<br>

             <strong>Lexical scoping:</strong> Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code.

             <strong>Scope:</strong> Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared<br>
             There is global scope, function scope, and block scope.<br>

             <h3>Hoisting In JavaScript</h3>

             <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared<br>
             "variables lifted to the top of their scope".

             <h3>The Scope Chain</h3>
