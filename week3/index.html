            <h3>Function Review</h3>

                <p>
                    There are 3 main function types that can be used in javascript.<br>
                    1. Function Declaration: Functions that can be used before it's declared.<br>
                    2. Function Expression: Essentially a function value stored in a variable.<br> 
                    3. Arrow Function: Great for a quick one-line functions. Has no this keyword.<br>

                    <h4>Anatomy of a Function</h4>
                    <p>
                    A function has a lot of moving parts that we need to remember. I saw this while watching a video and I think it explains it very well.
                    </p>

            <h3>Array Review</h3>
                
                <p>
                    There are two main ways to make an array.<br> 
                    Examples:<br> 
                    const friends = ['Preston', 'Kendra', 'Mario'];<br>
                    const years = new Array(1456, 1998, 1995, 2020);<br> 
                    Most of the time when making arrays you use the first one but both of them work the same way.<br>
                    You can put what ever you want into an array ints, strings, floats.<br>
                    <strong>Array Methods<br></strong>
                    Arrays have a ton of really cool methods you can use to manipulate the data in side of them.<br>
                    All of my examples of the methods will be in the console!
